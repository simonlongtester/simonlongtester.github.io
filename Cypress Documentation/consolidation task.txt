WHAT DO I NEED TO GET GOING ON CYPRESS? https://testautomationu.applitools.com/cypress-tutorial/chapter1.html

reccomend on a AWS instance as local laptop has restrictions



PRE-REQ 1
	INSTALL NODE https://nodejs.org/en/

		If you already have NodeJS installed, ensure that the version is equal or greater than v8. Let’s see how.

		Open a terminal window and type:


		node --version


PRE- REQ 2
	install visual studio code - why?  To allow you to create files , scripts  and also allows you to open up a command line / terminal
	https://code.visualstudio.com/

PRE-REQ 3
	ACCESS TO AWS INSTANCE

Installing Cypress via NPM - Node Package manage

1. CREATE A NEW PROJECT FOLDER - THIS IS WHERE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH CYPRESS WILL BE STORED INCLUDING FILES TO RUN.
	EITHER CREATE A FOLDER USING WINDOWS EXPLORE OR USING VISUAL STUDIO TERMINAL Window (mkdir FOLDERNAME)
2. Now we need to create a Package.JSON file in the root of the main folder
 	open a VS Code terminal and run npm init -y.
		This is effectly a config file for the project and contains dependancies.  for example Cypress will be a dependancy for this project to run

3. In the new project folder now there should be a package.json folder.  
	When we install cypress, NPM needs to register the fact that Cypress is installed in our test folder, and it does so inside our package.json. This is why we need the package.json, and which is why we ran npm init -y.
4.In the VS Code terminal window we can now download and install cypress to that specifc folder.
	Type in on command line :   npm install cypress@3
	
	Note About Cypress NPM Installation
	The first time on your computer, it might take a while, because besides the Cypress code, it’s also downloading a special version of Chrome that it will use to run the app and the tests. 
	So, yeah, that’s another thing about Cypress — it currently runs your apps only under Chrome.

5. Run Cypress
