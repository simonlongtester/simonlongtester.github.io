## Simon Long Tester - <i>| Coach | Leader | Advocate | </i>

### Loves talking and doing all things testing related !  

#### The blurb about me

I am passionate about the art and craft of Testing.  I strongly believe that testing in all its various forms is a creative process.  I am lucky enough to have spent 13 years doing something that really gets me out of bed every morning, experiencing different environments from Financial Services , Higher Education , Retail (Food) to my current role in Retail E-Commerce.

My journey in testing has led me into various exciting roles such as Test Analysis, Test Lead, Test Management and now a Test Coach role! I have also jumped into Defect Management roles on numerous projects, something I still consider one of my go-to comfort skills!  Life is never boring as a tester :)

I am personally proud to have shaped and lead a Technical Testing Team as well as developing and implementing a new testing capability at a UK University. Oh , and I do not count myself as technical - something I am trying to address :)
